lyrics
"Why have You chosen me out of millions Your child to be?
You know all the wrong that I have done.
O how could you pardon me, forgive my iniquity,
to save me give Jesus Your Son?
But Lord help me be what You want me to be.
Your word I will strive to obey.
My life I now give, for You I will live,
and walk by Your side all the way.

I am amazed to know that a God so great could love me so,
He is willing and wanting to bless.
His grace is so wonderful, His mercy is so bountiful,
I can not understand it I confess.
O Lord help me be what You want me to be.
Your word I will strive to obey.
My life I now give, for You I will live,
and walk by Your side all the way.

In this world of darkness many lives are filled with emptiness,
They too need to know of Your love.
O Lord help me point to them the truth, the life, the way,
and bless each life I meet day to day.
O Lord help me be what You want me to be.
Your word I will strive to obey.
My life I now give, for You I will live,
and walk by Your side all the way."
"Come, we that love the Lord,
and let our joys be known.
Join in a song with sweet accord,
join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

The sorrows of the mind
be banished from the place.
Religion never was designed,
Religion never was designed
To make our pleasures less,
To make our pleasures less.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing,
who never knew our God.
But children of the heavenly King,
but children of the heavenly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

The men of grace have found
glory begun below.
Celestial fruits on earthly ground,
celestial fruits on earthly ground,
from faith and hope may grow,
From faith and hope may grow.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
before we reach the heavenly fields,
before we reach the heavenly fields,
or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Then let our songs abound,
and every tear be dry.
We are marching through Immanuel is ground,
We are marching through Immanuel is ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.
We are marching to Zion,
beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We are marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God."
"More like the Master, I would ever be,
more of His meekness, more humility,
More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,
More consecration for work He bids me do.
Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone.
Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own.
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore.

More like the Master is my daily prayer,
more strength to carry crosses I must bear,
more earnest effort to bring His kingdom in,
More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.
Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone.
Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own.
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore.

More like the Master, I would live and grow,
more of His love to others I would show,
more self-denial, like His in Galilee,
more like the Master, I long to ever be.
Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone.
Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own.
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore."
"I would be true, for there are those who trust me.
I would be pure, for there are those who care.
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer.
I would be brave, for there is much to dare,
I would be brave, for there is much to dare.

I would be friend of all the foe, the friendless.
I would be giving, and forget the gift.
I would be humble, for I know my weakness.
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift,
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.

I would be faithful through each passing moment.
I would be constantly in touch with God.
I would be strong to follow where He leads me.
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod,
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.

Who is so low that I am not his brother?
Who is so high that I have no path to him?
Who is so poor I may not feel his hunger?
Who is so rich I may not pity him?
Who is so rich I may not pity him?

Who is so hurt I may not know his heartache?
Who sings for joy my heart may never share?
Who in God is heaven has passed beyond my vision?
Who to Hell is depths where I may never fare?
Who to Hell is depths where I may never fare?"
"From glory to glory He is changing me,
changing me, changing me.
His likeness and image to perfect in me;
The love of God shown to the world.
For He is changing, changing me
From earthly things to the heavenly.
His likeness and image to perfect in me;
The love of God shown to the world."
"May the mind of Christ, my Savior,
live in me from day to day.
By His love and power controlling
All I do and say.

May the Word of God dwell richly
in my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
only through His power.

May the peace of God, my Father,
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.

May the love of Jesus fill me
as the waters fill the sea.
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.

May I run the race before me,
strong and brave to face the foe.
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go.

May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win;
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him."
"O Love that will not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee.
I give Thee back the life I owe,
that in Thine ocean depths its flow
may richer, fuller be.

O Light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee.
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
that in Thy sunshine is blaze its day
may brighter, fairer be.

O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee.
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
and feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.

O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee.
I lay in dust life is glory dead,
and from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be."
"I am pressing on the upward way,
new heights I am gaining every day.
Still praying as I onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
by faith, on heaven is tableland;
a higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay.
Though some may dwell where those abound,
my prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
by faith, on heaven is tableland;
a higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
though Satan is darts at me are hurled.
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
by faith, on heaven is tableland;
a higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright.
But still I will pray till heaven I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
by faith, on heaven is tableland;
a higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."
"Thy loving kindness is better than life.
Thy loving kindness is better than life.
My lips shall praise Thee, Thus will I bless Thee,
I will lift up my hands unto Thy Name.

I lift my hands, Lord, unto Thy name.
I lift my hands, Lord, unto Thy name.
My lips shall praise Thee, Thus will I bless Thee,
I will lift up my hands unto Thy Name.

Remembering Thee, Lord, Iam satisfied.
Remembering Thee, Lord, Iam satisfied.
My lips shall praise Thee, Thus will I bless Thee,
I will lift up my hands unto Thy Name.

Safe in Thy shadow, I will rejoice.
Safe in Thy shadow, I will rejoice.
My lips shall praise Thee, Thus will I bless Thee,
I will lift up my hands unto Thy Name."
"Lord of the universe, hope of the world,
Lord of the limitless reaches of space,
here on this planet you put on our flesh,
vastness confined in the womb of a maid,
born in our likeness you ransomed our race.
Savior, we worship You, praise and adore.
help us to honor you more and yet more,
help us to honor you more and yet more!

Lord of the universe, hope of the world,
Lord of the infinite eons of time,
You came among us, lived our brief years,
tasted our griefs, our aloneness, our fears,
conquered our death, made eternity ours.
Savior, we worship You, praise and adore.
help us to honor you more and yet more,
help us to honor you more and yet more!


Lord of the universe, hope of the world,
send out your light to the ends of the earth.
May we who know you obey your command,
go with the grace of your gospel to all,
bringing salvation and freedom and joy.
Savior, we worship You, praise and adore.
help us to honor you more and yet more,
help us to honor you more and yet more!


Lord of the universe, hope of the world,
how Your creation cries out for release,
looks for you, longs for you, watches and waits,
prays for your kingdom of justice and peace!
Maker, Redeemer, triumphant One, come!
Savior, we worship You, praise and adore.
help us to honor you more and yet more,
help us to honor you more and yet more!

"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There is light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free!
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
look full in His wonderful face.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting,
He passed, and we follow Him there.
Over us sin no more hath dominion
for more than conquerors we are!
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
look full in His wonderful face.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

His word shall not fail you, He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well.
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
look full in His wonderful face.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace."
"There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God;
A place where sin cannot molest,
Near to the heart of God.
O Jesus, blest redeemer,
Sent from the heart of God;
Hold us, who wait before Thee,
Near to the heart of God.

There is a place of comfort sweet,
Near to the heart of God;
a place where we our Savior meet,
Near to the heart of God.
O Jesus, blest redeemer,
Sent from the heart of God;
Hold us, who wait before Thee,
Near to the heart of God.

There is a place of full release,
Near to the heart of God;
A place where all is joy and peace,
Near to the heart of God.
O Jesus, blest redeemer,
Sent from the heart of God;
Hold us, who wait before Thee,
Near to the heart of God."
"Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Hold over my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me."
"Have you a heart that is weary,
tending a load of care?
Are you a soul that is seeking
Rest from the burden you bear?
Do you know my Jesus?
Do you know, my friend?
Have you heard He loves you,
And that He will abide till the end?

Where is your heart, oh, pilgrim?
What does your light reveal?
Who hears your call for comfort,
when naught but sorrow you feel?
Do you know my Jesus?
Do you know, my friend?
Have you heard He loves you,
And that He will abide till the end?

Who knows your disappointments?
Who hears each time you cry?
Who understands your heartaches?
Who dries the tears from your eyes?
Do you know my Jesus?
Do you know, my friend?
Have you heard He loves you,
And that He will abide till the end?"
"Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
and that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, though tossed about
with many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
With welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, Yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come."
"Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief.
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
would I seek Thy face.
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me.
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by."
"Open my eyes, that I may see
glimpses of truth Thou hast for me.
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
ready my God, Thy will to see.
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit divine!

Open my ears, that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave notes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.

Open my mind, that I may read
more of Thy love in word and deed.
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead.

Open my mouth, and let me bear
gladly the warm truth everywhere.
Open my heart and let me prepare,
Love with Thy children thus to share."
"Sing them over again to me,
wonderful words of life.
Let me more of their beauty see,
wonderful words of life.
Words of life and beauty, teach me faith and duty.
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life.
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life.

Christ, the blessed One, gives to all
wonderful words of life.
Sinner, list to the loving call,
wonderful words of life.
all so freely given, wooing us to heaven.

Sweetly echo the Gospel call,
wonderful words of life;
offer pardon and peace to all,
wonderful words of life.
Jesus, only Savior, sanctify us forever."
"Hover over me, Holy Spirit,
bathe my trembling heart and brow.
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Holy Spirit, fill me now.
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
though I cannot tell Thee how.
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
Come, O come and fill me now.

I am weakness, full of weakness,
at Thy sacred feet I bow.
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
fill with power, and fill me now.

Cleanse and comfort, wholly save me,
bathe, O bathe my heart and brow.
Thou dost sanctify and seal me,
Thou art sweetly filling now."
"Like the woman at the well, I was seeking
for things that could not satisfy.
And then I heard my Savior speaking,
Draw from my well that never shall run dry.
Fill my cup, Lord; I lift it up, Lord.
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul.
Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

There are millions in this world who are seeking
for pleasures earthly goods afford.
But none can match the wondrous treasure
that I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord.

So my brother, if the things that this world gives you,
leave hungers that will not pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to him and humbly pray."
"The way of the Cross means sacrifice,
as to God you yield your all.
To be laid on the altar, the place of death,
Where fire will surely fall.
It is the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who have given yourself, your all to God!
To God are you wholly true?

As the voice of song and prayer we raise,
how easy to say, We give all.
Till some rougher cross lies just before,
And sterner is duty is call.

Do you falter then, or true to death,
Just die on the cross in the way,
Till the fulness of life from the Living One
Is filling you day by day?

It is the plan of life, for you die to live,
One with Jesus crucified;
With the life alone to be lived through you,
Of the Risen, the Glorified."
"Living for Jesus, a life that is true,
striving to please Him in all that I do.
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.
O Jesus, Lord and Savior, I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy atonement, didst give Thyself for me.
I own no other Master, my heart shall be Thy throne;
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.

Living for Jesus Who died in my place,
bearing on Calvary my sin and disgrace.
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

Living for Jesus, wherever I am,
doing each duty in His holy name,
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

Living for Jesus through earth is little while,
my dearest treasure, the light of His smile.
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him."
"Take my life and let it be
consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Take my moments and my days;
let them flow in endless praise,
let them flow in endless praise.

Take my hands and let them move
at the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet and let them be
swift and beautiful for Thee,
swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice and let me sing,
always, only, for my King.
Take my lips and let them be
filled with messages from Thee,
filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold;
not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect and use
every power as Thou shalt choose,
every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will and make it Thine;
it shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
it shall be Thy royal throne,
it shall be Thy royal throne.

"Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me;
All His wonderful passion and purity.
O Thou Spirit Divine, all my nature refine,
Till the beauty of Jesus be seen in me."
"Ke mana saja ku telah sedia,
pimpinan Tuhan tak pernah bersalah.
Tolong ku taat memikul salibku;
Tuhan, pimpinan-Mu sempurna.
Dalam kota besar atau dalam rimba,
Jiwa sama berharga di mata-Mu.
Ke mana saja ku telah sedia,
ku mau cinta yang dicinta Hu."
"Lead me to some soul today,
O teach me, Lord, just what to say.
Friends of mine are lost in sin
and cannot find their way.
Few there are who seem to care
and few there are who pray.
Melt my heart and fill my life,
give me one soul today."
"I am happy in the service of the King,
I am happy, O so happy!
I have peace and joy that nothing else can bring,
In the service of the King.
In the service of the King,
every talent I will bring.
I have peace and joy and blessing
In the service of the King.

I am happy in the service of the King,
I am happy, O so happy!
Through the sunshine and the shadow I can sing,
In the service of the King.

I am happy in the service of the King,
I am happy, O so happy!
To His guiding hand forever I will cling,
In the service of the King.

I am happy in the service of the King,
I am happy, O so happy!
All that I possess to Him I gladly bring,
In the service of the King."
"Sound the battle cry! See, the foe is nigh;
raise the standard high for the Lord.
Gird your armor on, stand firm every one,
Rest your cause upon His holy Word.
Rouse, then, soldiers, rally round the banner.
Ready, steady, pass the word along.
Onward, forward, shout aloud, Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

Strong to meet the foe, marching on we go,
while our cause we know must prevail.
Shield and banner bright, gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right we never can fail.

O Thou God of all, hear us when we call,
help us one and all by Thy grace.
When the battle is done, and the victory is won,
May we wear the crown before Thy face."

Send the light! Send the light!
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,

Send the light, the blessed Gospel light,
Let it shine from shore to shore!
Send the light, and let its radiant beams
light the world forevermore!

We have heard the Macedonian call today,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden offering at the cross we lay,
send the light, send the light!

Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound,
send the light, send the light!
And a Christlike spirit everywhere be found,
send the light, send the light!

Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
send the light, send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
send the light, send the light!"
"Out in the highways and byways of life,
Many are weary and sad;
Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife,
Making the sorrowing glad.
Make me a blessing, Make me a blessing,
Out of my life may Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing, O Savior, I pray,
Make me a blessing to someone today.

Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love;
Tell of His power to forgive;
Others will trust Him if only you prove,
True every moment you live.

Give as it was given to you in your need;
Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed,
Unto your mission be true."
"We have a story to tell to the nations,
that shall turn their hearts to the right,
a story of truth and mercy,

a story of peace and light.
For the darkness shall turn to dawning,

and Christ is great kingdom shall come on earth,
the kingdom of love and light.

We have a song to be sung to the nations,
that shall lift their hearts to the Lord,
a song that shall conquer evil
and shatter the spear and sword,
and shatter the spear and sword.

We have a message to give to the nations,
that the Lord who reigneth above
hath sent us His Son to save us,
and show us that God is love,
and show us that God is love.

We have a Savior to show to the nations,
who the path of sorrow hath trod,
that all of the world is great peoples
may come to the truth of God,
may come to the truth of God."
"How lovely, O Lord, is Your dwelling place.
My heart yearns, even faints, for the court of the Lord;
my heart, my flesh, cry out for You.
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house,
They are ever praising You.

Blessed are those whose strength is in You,
In whose heart are the highways, the highways to Zion.
As they go through the Valley of Baca,
they make it a place of springs.
They go from strength to strength.

Behold our shield, O God, look on our face!
For a day in your courts is better than thousand elsewhere.
For the Lord God is a sun and shield.
No good thing does He withhold from us.
Blessed is the one who trusts in You!"
"I, the Lord of sea and sky,
I have heard My people cry.
All who dwell in dark and sin, My hand will save.
I who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright.
Who will bear My light to them? Whom shall I send?
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go, Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.

I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne My peoples pain.
I have wept for love of them; they turn away.
I will break their hearts of stone,
give them hearts for love alone.
I will speak My word to them, whom shall I send?

I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will tend the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them, My hand will save.
Finest bread I will provide,
till their hearts be satisfied.
I will give My life to them, whom shall I send?"
"May we be a shining light to the nations,
A shining light to the peoples of the earth,
till the whole world sees the glory of Your name.
May Your pure light shine through us.

May we bring a word of hope to the nations,
a word of life to the peoples of the earth,
till the whole world knows there is salvation through Your name.
May Your mercy flow through us.

May we be a healing balm to the nations,
A healing balm to the peoples of the earth,
till the whole world knows the power of Your name.
May Your healing flow through us.

May we sing a song of joy to the nations,
A song of praise to the peoples of the earth,
till the whole world rings with the praises of Your name.
May Your song be sung through us.

May Your kingdom come to the nations,
Your will be done in the peoples of the earth,
till the whole world knows that Jesus Christ is Lord.
May Your kingdom come on earth."
"Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord.
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored.
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword.
His truth is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires
of a hundred circling camps.
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps.
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps.
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never call retreat.
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat.
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him;
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me.
As He died to make men holy,
let us live to make men free,
While God is marching on.

We can almost hear the trumpet sound,
the Lord is return is near.
There are still so many people lost,
His message they must hear.
Father, give us one more moment,
one more day, just one more year.
With God we are marching on!"
"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He will prepare for us a place.
When we all get to heaven,
what a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We will sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky.
But when traveling days are over,
not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day.
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we will behold.
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
"According to Thy gracious word,
in meek humility,
this will I do, my dying Lord,
I will remember thee.

Thy body, broken for my sake,
my bread from heaven shall be;
Thy testamental cup I take,
and thus remember Thee.

Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there Thy conflict see,
Thine agony and bloody sweat,
and not remember Thee?

When to the cross I turn mine eyes,
and rest on Calvary,
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
I must remember thee.

Remember Thee and all Thy pains,
and all Thy love to me;
Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,
I will remember Thee.

And when these failing lips grow dumb,
and mind and memory flee,
when Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,
Jesus, remember me!"
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside the still waters.
He restores my soul.
He leads me for His name is sake."
"Above all powers, above all kings;
above all nature, and all created things;
above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones;
above all wonders the world has ever known;
above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there is no way to measure what You are worth.
Crucified, laid behind the stone,
You lived to die, rejected and alone.
Like a rose, trampled on the ground,
You took the fall, and thought of me, above all."
"O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

And when I think of God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
And lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow with humble adoration,
And then proclaim: My God, how great Thou art!"
"Worthy of worship, worthy of praise,
Worthy of honor and glory,
Worthy of all the glad songs we can sing,
Worthy of all of the offerings we bring.

You are worthy, Father, Creator.
You are worthy, Savior, Sustainer.
You are worthy, worthy and wonderful,
Worthy of worship and praise.

Worthy of reverence, worthy of fear,
Worthy of love and devotion,
Worthy of bowing and bending of knees,
Worthy of all this and added to these.

Almighty Father, Master and Lord,
King of all kings and Redeemer,
Wonderful Counselor, Comforter, Friend,
Savior and Source of our life without end."
"Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, O Earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy Name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children;
in His arms He carries them all day long.

Praise Him! Praise Him!
Tell of His excellent greatness.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Ever in joyful song!

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died.
He our Rock, our Hope of eternal salvation.
Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
Sound His praises! Jesus who bore our sorrows;
love unbounded, wonderful, deep, and strong.

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Savior, reigneth forever and ever.
Crown Him! Crown Him! Prophet, and Priest, and King!
Christ is coming! Over the world victorious;
Power and glory unto the Lord belong."
"To God be the glory, great things He hath done;
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life our redemption to win,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

Praise the Lord! praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see."
"For the beauty of the earth,
For the glory of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
over and around us lies;

Lord of all, to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour,
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,
sun and moon, and stars of light;

For the joy of ear and eye,
For the heart and mind's delight,
For the mystic harmony
linking sense to sound and sight;

For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth and friends above,
for all gentle thoughts and mild;

For thy Church, that evermore
Lifteth holy hands above,
Offering up on every shore
her pure sacrifice of love;

For the martyrs' crown of light,
For Thy prophets' eagle eye,
For Thy bold confessors' might,
for the lips of infancy;

For each perfect gift of Thine
To our race so freely given,
Graces human and divine,
flow'rs of earth and buds of heaven;"
"This is my Father's world,
and to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
the music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world,
the birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world.
O let me never forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
the battle is not done:
Jesus Who died shall be satisfied,
And earth and Heav'n be one.

This is my Father's world,
dreaming, I see His face.
I open my eyes, and in glad surprise cry,
The Lord is in this place.
This is my Father's world,
from the shining courts above,
The Beloved One, His Only Son,
came a pledge of deathless love.

This is my Father's world,
should my heart be ever sad?
The Lord is King — let the heavens ring,
God reigns let the earth be glad.
This is my Father's world.
Now closer to Heaven bound,
For dear to God is the earth Christ trod,
no place but is holy ground.

This is my Father's world.
I walk a desert lone.
In a bush ablaze to my wondering gaze
God makes His glory known.
This is my Father's world,
a wanderer I may roam
Whatever my lot, it matters not,
My heart is still at home."
"Lord, who may dwell in Your tent,
who may live on Your holy hill?
He, whose walk is blameless
and who does what is righteous,
Who speaks the truth from his heart
And has no slander on his tongue,
Who does his neighbor no wrong
And casts no slur on his fellowman,
Who honors those who fear, who fear the Lord.
He who does these things will never be shaken,
will never be, never be shaken."
"God is our refuge and our strength,
our ever present aid.
And therefore, though the earth be moved,
we will not be afraid;
though hills into the seas be cast,
though foaming waters roar,
though all the mighty billows shake
the mountains on the shore.

A river flows whose streams make glad
the city of our God,
the holy place wherein the Lord
Most High has His abode.
Since God is in the midst of her,
unmoved her walls shall stand;
for God will hasten to her aid
when trouble is at hand.

The nations rage, the kingdoms move,
but when His voice is heard,
earth melts with trembling fear before
the thunder of His word.
The Lord of hosts is on our side,
our safety to secure;
the God of Jacob is for us
a refuge strong and sure.

O come and see that wondrous works
the hand of God has done.
Come, see what desolation great
he brings beneath the sun.
In every corner of the earth
he causes wars to cease;
the weapon of the strong destroyed,
He makes abiding peace.

Be still and know that I am God,
the Lord whom all must claim.
And every nation of the earth
shall magnify my name.
The Lord of Hosts is on our side,
our safety to secure;
the God of Jacob is for us
a refuge strong and sure."
"Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
As thou hast been, Thou forever will be.

Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!"
"Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage;
Your mighty Defender is always the same.
Mount up with wings, as the eagle ascending;
Victory is sure when you call on His name.

Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord;
And be of good courage, for He is your guide.
Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord;
And rejoice for the victory is yours.

So put on the armour the Lord has provided;
And place your defense in His unfailing care.
Trust Him, for He will be with you in battle;
Lighting your path to avoid every snare.

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage;
Your mighty commander will vanquish the foe.
Fear not the battle, for the victory is always His;
He will protect you wherever you go."
"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
redeemed me for His own.
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I have committed
unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
convincing us of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me;
Of weary ways or golden days,
before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
at night or noonday fair;
Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
or meet Him in the air."
"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

This is my story, this is my song,
praising my Savior, all the day long.
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior, all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love."
"I trust in God wherever I may be,
upon the land, or on the rolling sea.
For come what may, from day to day,
My heavenly Father watches over me.

I trust in God, I know He cares for me,
on mountain bleak or on the stormy sea.
Though billows roll, He keeps my soul;
My heavenly Father watches over me.

He makes the rose an object of His care,
He guides the eagle through the pathless air,
and surely He remembers me,
My heavenly Father watches over me.

I trust in God, for, in the lion's den,
On battlefield, or in the prison pen,
through praise or blame, through flood or flame,
My heavenly Father watches over me.

The valley may be dark, the shadows deep,
But, oh, the Shepherd guards His lonely sheep;
And through the gloom He'll lead me home,
My heavenly Father watches over me."
"Silent night, holy night,
all is calm, all is bright.
Round yon virgin mother and Child;
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ the Savior is born.
Christ the Savior is born!

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light;
radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Silent night, holy night,
Wondrous star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Savior is born.
Christ the Savior is born!"
"For God so loved the world, He gave His only Son,
To die on Calvary's tree, from sin to set me free.
Someday He is coming back, what glory that will be!
Wonderful His love to me."
"Hark! The herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
with the angelic host proclaim,
Christ is born in Bethlehem!
Hark! The herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!

Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord!
Late in time, behold Him come,
offspring of the favored one.
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;
hail, the incarnate Deity.
Pleased, as man, with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel.
Hark! The herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!

Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
risen with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
born that man no more may die,
born to raise the sons of earth,
born to give them second birth.
Hark! The herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!"
"O mighty cross, love lifted high;
The Lord of life raised there to die.

His sacrifice on Calvary
has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me.

O mighty cross, what throne of grace;
He knew no sin, yet took my place.

O mighty cross, O Christ so pure;
Love held Him there, such shame endured.

O mighty cross, my soul's release;
The stripes He bore have brought me peace."
"There are things as we travel this earth's shifting sands,
that transcend all the reason of man;
But the things that matter the most in this world
they can never be held in our hand.

I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary.
I believe whatever the cost;
And when time has surrendered and earth is no more,
I will still cling to the old rugged cross.

I believe that the Christ who was slain on that cross,
has the power to change lives today;
For He changed me completely, a new life is mine,
that is why by the cross I will stay.

I believe that this life with its great mysteries,
surely someday will come to an end;
But faith will conquer the darkness and death,
And will lead me at last to my Friend."
"King of my life, I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary."
"I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses.

And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of His voice,
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling."
"There is within my heart a melody;
Jesus whispers sweet and low,
Fear not, I am with you, peace, be still,
in all of life's ebb and flow.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
sweetest name I know,
fills my every longing,
keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
stirred the slumbering chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
resting beneath His sheltering wing,
always looking on His smiling face,
that is why I shout and sing.

Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,
trials fall across the way;
though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
see His footprints all the way.

Soon He is coming back to welcome me
far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high."
"There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, God's own Son;
precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Holy One.

Thank you, O my Father, for giving us Your Son,
and leaving Your Spirit till the work on earth is done.

Jesus my Redeemer,
name above all names;
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Hope for sinners slain.

When I stand in glory,
I will see His face.
There I will serve my King forever
in that holy place."
"Deep in my heart there is a gladness,
Jesus has saved me from sin!
Praise to His name, what a Savior!
Cleansing without and within!

Why do I sing about Jesus?
Why is He precious to me?
He is my Lord and my Savior;
Dying, He set me free!

Only a glimpse of His goodness,
That was sufficient for me.
Only one look at the Savior,
Then was my spirit set free.

He is the fairest of fair ones;
He is the Lily, the Rose.
Rivers of mercy surround Him;
grace, love, and pity He shows."
"O what a wonderful, wonderful day,
day I will never forget.
After I'd wandered in darkness away,
Jesus, my Savior I met.
O what a tender, compassionate friend,
He met the need of my heart.
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart!

Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.
When at the cross the Savior made me whole.
My sins were washed away, and my night was turned to day.
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!"
"Every promise we can make, every prayer and step of faith,
Every difference we will make, is only by His grace.
Every mountain we will climb, every ray of hope we shine,
Every blessing left behind, is only by His grace.

Grace alone which God supplies,
strength unknown He will provide.
Christ in us, our cornerstone,
we will go forth in grace alone.

Every soul we long to reach, every heart we hope to teach,
Everywhere we share His peace, is only by His grace.
Every loving word we say, every tear we wipe away,
Every sorrow turned to praise, is only by His grace."
"Why did Jesus give up heaven's glory
For this world of sin and misery?
Why did Jesus suffer in the garden,
Drain the bitter cup of agony?
Why did Jesus stand in Pilate's judgement hall,
Wear that cruel crown of thorns so patiently?
Why did Jesus give His life to save me?
It was love, God's wondrous love for me!

Why does Jesus lift me when I stumble
Take my hand whene'er I go astray?
Give the strength I need for each tomorrow,
Grace to face the trials of the day?
Why does Jesus share the load I cannot bear,
Fill my soul with peace and joy beyond degree?
And why does He watch o'er me and keep me?
It was love, God's wondrous love for me!"
"Not what my hands have done
can save my guilty soul.
Not what my toiling flesh has borne
can make my spirit whole.
Not what I feel or do
can give me peace with God.
Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
can bear my awful load.

Your voice alone, O Lord,
can speak to me of grace.
Your power alone, O Son of God,
can all my sin erase.
No other work but Yours,
no other blood will do,
no strength but that which is divine
can bear me safely through.

Thy work alone, O Christ,
can ease this weight of sin.
Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
can give me peace within.
Thy love to me, O God,
not mine, O Lord, to Thee,
can rid me of this dark unrest,
and set my spirit free.

I bless the Christ of God;
I rest on love divine.
And with unfalt'ring lip and heart
I call this Savior mine.
His cross dispels each doubt;
I bury in His tomb
each thought of unbelief and fear,
each lingering shade of gloom.

I praise the Christ of God;
I rest on love divine.
And with unfaltering lip and heart
I call this Savior mine.
My Lord has saved my life
and freely pardon gives.
I love because He first loved me,
I live because He lives."
"Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,
Thou fount of life, Thou light of men;
from the best bliss that earth imparts,
we turn unfilled to Thee again.
Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
wherever our changeful lot is cast.
glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
blest when our faith can hold Thee fast.

The truth unchanged hath ever stood;
Thou savest those that on Thee call;
to them that seek Thee, Thou art good,
to them that find Thee, all in all.
Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
wherever our changeful lot is cast.
glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
blest when our faith can hold Thee fast.

We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
and long to feast upon Thee still;
we drink of Thee, the fountain head,
and thirst our souls from Thee to fill.
O Jesus, ever with us stay,
make all our moments calm and bright,
chase the dark night of sin away,
shed over the world Thy holy light."
"Jesus is all the world to me,
my Life, my Joy, my All.
He is my Strength from day to day,
without Him I would fall.
When I am sad, to Him I go;
no other one can cheer me so.
When I am sad, He makes me glad;
He is my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
my Friend in trials sore.
I go to Him for blessings, and
He gives them over and over.
He sends the sunshine and the rain;
He sends the harvest's golden grain.
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain;
He is my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
and true to Him I will be.
Oh, how could I this Friend deny,
when He is so true to me?
Following Him I know I'm right;
He watches over me day and night.
Following Him by day and night;
He is my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
I want no better Friend.
I trust Him now, I will trust Him when
life's fleeting days shall end.
Beautiful life with such a Friend;
beautiful life that has no end.
Eternal life, eternal joy;
He is my Friend."
"Lead me to some soul today,
O teach me, Lord, just what to say.
Friends of mine are lost in sin
and cannot find their way.
Few there are who seem to care
and few there are who pray.
Melt my heart and fill my life,
give me one soul today."
"God is here, and that to bless us
with the Spirit's quickening power.
See, the cloud already bending,
Waits to drop the grateful shower.
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee,
let the shower of blessing fall.
We are waiting, we are waiting,
Oh, revive the hearts of all.

God is here! we feel His presence
in this consecrated place.
But we need the soul refreshing
Of His free, unbounded grace.

God is here! oh, then, believing,
Bring to Him our one desire,
That His love may now be kindled,
Till its flame each heart inspire.

Savior, grant the prayer we offer,
while in simple faith we bow.
From the windows of Thy mercy,
Pour us out a blessing now."
"Be still for the presence of the Lord
The Holy One is here
Come, bow before Him now
With reverence and fear
In Him no sin is found
We stand on holy ground
Be still for the presence of the Lord
The Holy One is here.

Be still for the glory of the Lord
Is shining all around
He burns with holy fire
With splendour He is crowned
How awesome is the sight
Our radiant King of light
Be still for the glory of the Lord
Is shining all around.

Be still for the power of the Lord
Is moving in this place
He comes to cleanse and heal
To minister His grace
No work too hard for Him
In faith receive from Him
Be still for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place."
"Before the throne of God above,
I have a strong and perfect plea,
a great High Priest whose name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart.
I know that while in heav'n He stands,
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look and see Him there,
who made an end of all my sin.
Because the sinless Savior died,
my sinful soul is counted free.
For God, the just is satisfied,
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him there! the risen Lamb!
my perfect, spotless righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
One with Himself, I cannot die;
my soul is purchased by His blood,
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Savior and my God,
with Christ, my Savior and my God."
"Be still, my soul; the Lord is on thy side.
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change, He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake
to guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul; though dearest friends depart,
And all is darkened in the vale of tears,
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,
who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears.
Be still, my soul; thy Jesus can repay
From His own fullness all He takes away.

Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
when we shall be forever with the Lord;
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last."
"O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home."
"What child is this, who laid to rest,
on Mary's lap is sleeping;
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and donkeys are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spears shall pierce him through,
the cross he bore for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
the Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own him.
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
the virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The babe, the Son of Mary."
"Spirit of the Living God, fall afresh on me,
Spirit of the Living God, fall afresh on me.
Melt me, mold me, fill me, use me,
Spirit of the Living God, fall afresh on me."
"Jesus shall reign wherever the sun
does its successive journeys run,
His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
till moons shall wax and wane no more.

To Him shall endless prayer be made,
and endless praises crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
with every morning sacrifice.

People and realms of every tongue
dwell on His love with sweetest song;
and infant voices shall proclaim
their early blessings on His name.

Blessings abound wherever He reigns:
the prisoner leaps, unloosed his chains,
the weary find eternal rest,
and all the sons of want are blest.

Where He displays His healing power,
Death and the curse are known no more;
In Him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.

Let every creature rise and bring
peculiar honours to our King;
angels descend with songs again,
and earth repeat the loud Amen!"
"Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing,
help us to praise!
Father all glorious,
Over all victorious,
come and reign over us,
Ancient of Days!

Come, Thou incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy mighty sword,
our prayer attend.
Come and Thy people bless,
and give Thy word success,
establish Thy righteousness,
Savior and Friend!

Come, holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear
in this glad hour.
Thou, who almighty art,
Now rule in every heart,
And never from us depart,
Spirit of power!

To the great One in Three,
Eternal praises be
hence evermore!
His sovereign majesty
May we in glory see,
and to eternity,
love and adore!"
"Would you be a victor over every foe,
Conquer every trial in this world below;
Overcome temptations that each day you meet?
Keep in touch with Jesus; He will keep you sweet.

Keep in touch with Jesus, though the path be dim;
Let no cloud nor shadow sever you from Him.
Joy or sorrow greet you, friend or foe you meet,
Keep in touch with Jesus; He will keep you sweet.

Many hearts are broken—oft an aching breast
Waits the message spoken that will give it rest;
You perhaps can bring them joy and peace complete,
Keep in touch with Jesus; He will keep you sweet.

Would you have communion with your Lord each day,
Have a blessed union with Him all the way;
Praying without ceasing, learning at His feet?
Keep in touch with Jesus; He will keep you sweet."
"Glory to God in the highest! Glory to God! Glory to God!
Glory to God in the highest! Shall be our song today;
Another year's rich mercies
prove His ceaseless care and boundless love;
So let our loudest voices raise
our glad and grateful song of praise.

Glory to God in the highest! Glory to God in the highest!
Glory, glory, glory, glory, Glory be to God on high!
Glory, glory, glory, glory, Glory be to God on high!

Glory to God in the highest! Glory to God! Glory to God!
Glory to God in the highest! Shall be our song today;
O, may we, an unbroken band,
around the throne of Jesus stand,
And there with angels and the throng,
of His redeemed ones, join the song."
"Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought by day or by night,
Waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle shield, Sword for the fight;
be Thou my Dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all."
"Take time to be holy,
speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always,
and feed on His Word.
Make friends of God's children,
help those who are weak,
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek.

Take time to be holy,
the world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret,
with Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus,
like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends in thy conduct
His likeness shall see.

Take time to be holy,
let Him be thy Guide;
And run not before Him,
whatever betide.
In joy or in sorrow,
still follow the Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
still trust in His Word.

Take time to be holy,
be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each motive
beneath His control.
Thus led by His Spirit
to fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted
for service above."
"God is in his temple,
the almighty Father;
round his footstool
let us gather;
him with adoration serve,
the Lord most holy,
who hath mercy on the lowly;
let us raise hymns of praise
for his great salvation:
God is in his temple!

Christ comes to his temple,
we, his word receiving,
are made happy in believing;
lo! from sin delivered
he hath turned our sadness,
our deep gloom to light and gladness;
let us raise hymns of praise,
for our bonds are severed:
Christ comes to his temple.

Come and claim thy temple,
gracious Holy Spirit;
in our hearts thy home inherit;
make in us thy dwelling,
thy high work fulfilling,
into ours thy will instilling,
till we raise hymns of praise
beyond mortal telling,
in the eternal temple."
"I sing the mighty power of God,
that made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
and built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
the sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at Gods command,
and all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord,
who filled the earth with food,
Who formed the creatures through the Word,
and then pronounced them good.
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed,
wherever I turn my eye,
If I survey the ground I tread,
or gaze upon the sky.

There is not a plant or flower below,
but makes Thy glories known,
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
by order from Thy throne;
While all that borrows life from Thee
is ever in Thy care;
And everywhere that we can be,
Thou, God, art present there."
"Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;
To His feet thy tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
evermore his praises sing:

Praise, Him, praise Him, alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.
Fatherlike He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame He knows;

In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
Widely yet His mercy flows.

Frail as summers flower we flourish,
Blows the wind and it is gone;
But while mortals rise and perish,
Our God lives unchanging on.

Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
Praise the high Eternal One!
Angels, help us to adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face;

Sun and moon, bow down before Him;
Dwellers all in time and space,
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
Praise with us the God of grace."
"Jesu, joy of mans desiring,
Holy wisdom, love most bright.
Drawn by Thee our souls aspiring,
Soar to uncreated light.
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned,
With the fire of faith impassioned,
Striving still to truth unknown,
Soaring dying round Thy throne."
"O for a heart to praise my God,
a heart from sin set free,
a heart that always feels Thy blood
So freely shed for me.

A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
from Christ who dwells within.

A heart in every thought renewed
And full of love divine,
Perfect and right and pure and good,
A copy, Lord, of thine.

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love."
"Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart, in my heart.
Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart, in my heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart, in my heart.

Lord, I want to be more holy in my heart, in my heart.
Lord, I want to be more holy in my heart, in my heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
Lord, I want to be more holy in my heart, in my heart.

Lord, I want to be like Jesus in my heart, in my heart.
Lord, I want to be like Jesus in my heart, in my heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
Lord, I want to be like Jesus in my heart, in my heart."
"Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
Living with Jesus a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord I am Thine,

Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear;
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I am under His care.

Never a heartache and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne,
Moement by moment, He thinks of His own.

Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus My Saviour, abides with me still."
"Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He, whose Word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation is walls surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear,
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near;
Thus deriving from our banner
Light by night and shade by day,
Safe they feed upon the manna,
Which He gives them when they pray.

Saviour, if of Zions city,
I through grace a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy name;
Fading is the worldlings pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure,
None but Zions children know."
"Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me;
See, on the portals He is waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.

Come home, come home,
You who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me.

Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me!
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me."
"Take the world but give me Jesus,
all its joys are but a name;
But His love abideth ever;
Through eternal years the same,

O the height and depth of mercy!
O the length and breadth of love!
O the fullness of redemption,
Pledge of endless life above.

Take the world but give me Jesus,
sweetest comfort of my soul;
with my Saviour watching over me;
I can sing tho billows roll.

Take the world but give me Jesus,
let me view His constant smile;
Then thruout my pilgrim journey,
light will cheer me all the while.

Take the world but give me Jesus,
in His cross my trust shall be;
till, with clearer, brighter vision,
face to face my Lord I see."
"Praise to the Holiest in the height,
and in depth be praise.
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.

O loving wisdom of our God!
When all was sin and shame,
A second Adam to the fight
and to the rescue came.

And that a higher gift than grace
should flesh and blood refine;
Gods Presence and His very Self,
And Essence all divine.

And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
and in depth be praise.
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways."
"O Lord of heaven and earth and sea, to thee all praise and glory be;
how shall we show our love thee, who givest all?

Thou didst not spare thine only Son, but gave him for a world undone,
and freely, with that blessed One, thou givest all.

Thou givest the Spirits blessed dower, Spirit of life and love and power,
and dost his sevenfold graces shower upon us all.

For souls redeemed, for sins forgive, for means of grace and hopes of heaven,
Father, all praise to thee be given, who givest all.

We lose what on ourselves we spend, we have as treasure without end
whatever, Lord, to thee we lend, who givest all.

To thee, from whom we all derive our life, our gifts, our power to give:
O may we ever with thee live, who givest all."
"There is a Name I love to hear, I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear, The sweetest Name on earth.

Oh, how I love Jesus, Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus, Because He first loved me!

It tells me of a Saviors love, Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood, The sinners perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath In store for every day,
And though I thread a darksome path, Yields sunshine all the way.

I tells of One whose loving heart Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears a part That none can bear below.

Jesus, the Name I love so well, The Name I love to hear:
No saint on earth its worth can tell, No heart conceive how dear.

And there with all the blood-bought throng,
From sin and sorrow free,
I will sing the new eternal song. Of Jesus love for me."
"Some thank the Lord for friends and home,
for mercies sure and sweet;
But I would praise Him for His grace
In prayer I would repeat;

Thank you Lord, for saving my soul,
Thank you Lord for making me whole,
Thank you Lord for giving to me,
Thy great salvation so rich and free.

Some thank Him for the flowers that grow,
some for the stars that shine;
My heart is filled with joy and praise
Because I know He is mine;

I trust in Him from day to day,
I prove His saving grace;
I will sing this song of praise to Him
Until I see His face;"
"O God beyond all praising we worship You today;
and sing the love amazing that songs cannot repay;
for we can only wonder at every gift You send,
at blessings without number and mercies without end;
we lift our hearts before You and wait upon Your word;
we honor and adore You, our great and mighty Lord.

Then hear, O gracious Savior, accept the love we bring;
that we who know Your favor may serve You as our King,
and whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill,
we will triumph through our sorrows and rise to bless You still;
to marvel at Your beauty and glory in Your ways;
and make a joyful duty our sacrifice of praise."
"Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.

Each newborn servant of the Crucified
Bears on the brow the seal of Him Who died.

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
As thou hast promised, draw the world to Thee.

So shall our song of triumph ever be:
Praise to the Crucified for victory."
"When Jesus comes to reward His servants,
whether it be noon or night,
Faithful to Him will He find us watching
With our lamps all trimmed and bright?

O can we say we are ready, brother?
Ready for the souls bright home?
Say, will He find you and me still watching,
waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?

If at the dawn of the early morning
He shall call us one by one,
when to the Lord we restore our talents,
Will He answer us, Well done?

Have we been true to the trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
We shall have a glorious rest.

Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,
in His glory they shall share.
If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,
Will He find us watching there?"
"Whisper a prayer in the morning, Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening, To keep your heart in tune.

God answers prayer in the morning, God answers prayer at noon,
God answers prayer in the evening, He will keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning, Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening, So keep your heart in tune."
"I will follow, I will follow, follow Him my Lord,
everywhere, anywhere, only follow Him.
Follow Jesus, follow Jesus to my final breath,
to the heaven I will follow Him.
By His spirit and by His Holy Word,
always sufficiently guide me.
In the gladness, in the sadness, I will follow Him,
I will follow Him forevermore."
"In Christ alone my hope is found;
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fear are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all Here
in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
the wrath of God was satisfied;
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
sins curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His, and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From lifes first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I will stand."
"When the weary, seeking rest,
to Thy goodness flee;
when the heavy laden cast
all their load on Thee;
when the troubled, seeking peace,
on Thy name shall call;
when the sinner, seeking life,
at Thy feet shall fall:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry,
in heaven, Thy dwelling place on high.

When the stranger asks a home,
all his toils to end;
when the hungry craveth food,
and the poor a friend;
when the widows weep to Thee,
sad and lone and low;
when the orphan brings to Thee
all his orphan woe:

When the worldling, sick at heart,
lifts his soul above;
when the prodigal looks back
to his Fathers love;
when the proud man, in his pride,
stops to seek Thy face;
when the burdened brings His guilt
to Thy throne of grace:"
"Our God is mighty, worthy of all praising;
Sing unto Him a glad triumphant song,
He is the Lord, supreme in earth and heaven,
To Him all strength and majesty be long.

Declare His glory among the nations,
through all creation His triumph sing;
Till all earths people bow in adoration
and Jesus Christ be everlasting King.

Our God is gracious, infinite in mercy.
He bridged the hopeless gulf our sin has made,
He gave His Son to purchase our salvation,
In Jesus Christ we meet God unafraid.

Our God is faithful, He will work within us,
Fulfilling all the purpose He has planned,
Cleansing our hearts and filling with His spirit,
To make us strong to keep His last command.

Our God is sovereign over all creation,
And soon His earth shall hear His mighty voice,
With shouts of joy the King shall come in splendor,
Lift up our hearts,  confess Him and rejoice!"
"Man of sorrows! What a name for the Son of God, who came,
Ruined sinners to reclaim! Halleujah, what a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood,
Sealed my pardon with His blood: Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

Guilty viles and helpless we, Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full atonement! Can it be? Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

Lifted up was He to die, It finished! was He cry;
Now in heaven exalted high: Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

When He comes our Glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring;
Then a new this song we will sing: Hallelujah, what a Saviour!"
"It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
my Jesus Savior! Yet this soul of mine
would of that love, in all its depth and length,
its height and breadth, and everlasting strength
know more and more.

It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
my Jesus Savior! Yet these lips of mine
would fain proclaim to sinners far and near,
a love which can remove all guilty fear,
and love beget.

It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
my Jesus Savior! Yet this heart of mine
would sing a love so rich, so full, so free,
which brought an undone sinner, such as me,
right home to God."
"Immortal, Invisible, God only wise,
in light in accessible hid from our eyes;
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting and silent as light,
nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all life Thou givest, to both great and small,
in all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
and wither and perish, but naught changeth Thee.

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
All praise we would render; O help us to see,
tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.

All laud we would render; O help us to see
Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.
And so let Thy glory, Almighty, impart,
Through Christ in History, Thy Christ to the heart."
"Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb of Calvary
Hallelujah, Hallelujah for He shed His blood for me,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb of Calvary,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah glorious Lamb of Calvary.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah wondrous King of Calvary,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah ever glorious victor He,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah tho hell seeks to shatter me,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah satans hosts will have to flee.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah loving Lord of Calvary,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah ever true and faithful He,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah dread storm clouds tho now I see,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah highest praise I will bring to Thee.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah Master King of Calvary,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah Thou hast wrote the victory,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah loud and honor ever to be,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah glorious Lamb of Calvary."
"Once I was bound by sins galling fetters,
chained like a slave, I struggled in vain.
But I received a glorious freedom,
when Jesus broke my fetters in twain.

Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
No more in chains of sin I repine!
Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
Now and forever He shall be mine.

Freedom from all the carnal affections;
freedom from envy, hatred, and strife.
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions;
freedom from all that saddened my life.

Freedom from pride and all sinful follies;
freedom from love and glitter of gold.
Freedom from evil, temper, and anger;
Glorious freedom rapture untold.

Freedom from fear with all of its torments;
freedom from care with all of lots pain.
Freedom in Christ, my blessed Redeemer,
He who has rent my fetters in twain."
"Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Praise Him above ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
Amen."
"Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all
hear me, O Savior, when I call;
Hear me, and from Thy dwelling place
Pour down the riches of Thy grace;

Jesus, my Lord, whom I adore,
help me to love you more and more! Amen

Jesus, too late I search for You
to pay the debt of love I owe;
How can I sing Your worthy fame,
the glorious beauty of Your Name?

Jesus, how strong Your love must be
that You should come to die for me;
How great the joy that You have brought,
so far exceeding hope or thought!

Jesus, Your love shall be my song,
to You my heart and soul belong:
My life is Yours, O Lord divine,
and You, dear Savior, You are mine:"
"Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
Tender to me the promise of His word;
In God my Savior shall my heart rejoice.

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name!
Make known His might, the deeds His Arm has done;
His mercy sure, from age to age the same;
His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might!
Powers and dominions lay their glory by.
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
the hungry fed, the humble lifted high.

Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word!
Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
to childrens children and forevermore!"
"Lord, I have shut the door,
 Here do I bow,
 Speak, for my soul attent,
 Turns to Thee now,
 Rebuke Thou what is vain,
 Counsel my soul,
 Thy holy will reveal,
 My will control.
 
 Lord, I have shut the door,
 Speak now the word,
 Which in the din and throng,
 Could not be heard,
 Hushed now my inner heart,
 Whisper Thy will,
 While I have come apart,
 While all is still.
 
 In this blest quietness
 Clamorings cease,
 Here in Thy presence dwells,
 Infinite peace,
 Yonder, the strife and cry,
 Yonder, the sin,
 Lord, I have shut the door,
 Thou art within.
 
 Lord, I have shut the door,
 Strengthen my heart,
 Yonder awaits the task,
 I share a part,
 Only through grace bestowed,
 May I be true,
 Here, while alone with Thee,
 My strength renew."
"All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.
I surrender all, I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame;
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to His Name!"
"Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Throw your soul is fresh, glowing ardor
 Into the battle for truth
 Jesus has set the example,
 Dauntless was He, young and brave;
 Give Him your loyal devotion;
 Give Him the best that you have.
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Clad in salvation is full armor,
 Join in the battle for truth.
 
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give Him first place in your heart;
 Give Him first place in your service;
 Consecrate every part,
 Give, and to you will be given;
 God His beloved Son gave;
 Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
 give Him the best that you have.
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Clad in salvation is full armor,
 Join in the battle for truth.
 
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Naught else is worthy His love;
 He gave Himself for your ransom,
 Gave up His glory above.
 Laid down His life without murmur,
 you from sin is ruin to save;
 Give Him your heart is adoration;
 Give Him the best that you have.
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Clad in salvation is full armor,
 Join in the battle for truth."
"I am thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
and it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died.
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
to Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
and my will be lost in Thine.

O the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love that I yet may know
Ere Thee face to face I see;
There are heights of joy that I yet may reach
Ere I rest in peace with Thee."
"Beautiful Savior, King of Creation
 Son of God and Son of Man!
 Truly I would love Thee, truly I would serve Thee,
 Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
 
 Fair are the meadows, Fair are the woodlands,
 Robed in the flowers of blooming spring;
 Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
 He makes our sorrowing spirit sing.
 
 Fair is the sunshine, Fair is the moonlight,
 Bright the sparkling stars on high;
 Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
 Than all the angels in the sky.
 
 Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations,
 Son of God and Son of Man!
 Glory and honor, Praise and adoration
 Now and forevermore be Thine!"
"Oh, spread the tidings around, wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts and human woes abound;
Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!
The Comforter has come, the Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heaven, the Father is promise given;
Oh, spread the tidings around, wherever man is found—
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,
As over the golden hills the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings, with healing in His wings,
To every captive soul a full deliverance brings;
And through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine
To wondering mortals tell the matchless grace divine—
That I, a child of hell, should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!

Sing till the echoes fly above the vaulted sky,
And all the saints above to all below reply,
In strains of endless love, the song that never will die:
The Comforter has come!"
"Each step I take my Saviour goes before me,
And with His loving hand He leads the way,
And with each breath I whisper, I adore Thee;
Oh, what joy to walk with Him each day.
Each step I take, I know that He will guide me;
To higher ground He ever leads me on.
Until some day the last step will be taken.
Each step I take just leads me closer home.

At times I feel my faith begin to waver,
When up ahead I see a chasm wide.
It is then I turn and look up to my Savior,
I am strong when He is by my side.

I trust in God, no matter come what may,
For life eternal is in His hand,
He holds the key that opens up the way,
That will lead me to the promised land."
"I have found a friend, who is all to me,
His love is ever true.
I love to tell how He lifted me
And what His grace can do for you.
Saved by His power divine,
Saved to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete
For I am saved, saved, saved!

He saves me from every sin and harm,
secures my soul each day.
I am leaning strong on His mighty arm;
I know He will guide me all the way.

When poor and needy and all alone,
In love He said to me,
Come unto Me and I will lead you home,
To live with Me eternally."
"Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,
whereon the Savior of the world was born!
Rise to adore the mystery of love
which hosts of angels chanted from above.
With them the joyful tidings first begun,
of God incarnate and the virgin is Son.

Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
who heard the angelic herald is voice, Behold,
I bring good tidings of a Savior is birth
to you and all the nations of the earth.
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word.
This day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord.

Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song.
He that was born upon this joyful day,
around us all His glory shall display.
Saved by His love, incessantly we sing
eternal praise to Heaven is almighty King."
"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear, now to his temple draw near,
Join me in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who over all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires ever have been
Granted in what He ordaineth.

Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
What need or grief ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him.
Let the Amen sound from His people again,
Gladly for aye we adore Him."
